# Mochi Bot
Hiüòç <br>
Let me, kiejaana, give you a quick introduction to the functionalities of my Discord bot:

## 1. Ping üí°
When u type `/ping` in the message bar of a channel, u get a reply from the bot with the ping/latency

## 2. Weather ‚õÖ
When u type `/weather`, you'll see that there are 2 options available (both required): <br>
- The first option is the ***location***: this is the location where you want to know the weather from (ex. Brussels). A nice thing to know about this: you can choose any city from all over the world in any language you want!
- The second option is the ***forecast***: here you have 3 choices. The first choice is **Next 15 days**: if you select this, you will get a weather forecast of the coming 15 days from now on. The second choice is **Next 24 hours**: if you select this, you will get a weather forecast of the coming 24 hours. The third and last choice is **Current weather**: if you select this, you will get a reply with the weather at this exact moment.

The information you'll receive in a reply from the bot is:
- Your selected location
- The date / hour of the forecast
- The temperature
- The UV index
- The icon (a description in words of how the day / hour will be; ex. 'partly cloudy day')

That's all (for this moment, work is still in progress‚è≥). If you have any questions or found some bugs (or maybe things to improve), you're always welcome to [contact me](mailto:kiejaana@gmail.com)! <br>
Have fun enjoying the botüíñ
